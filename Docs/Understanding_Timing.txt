Timing in Helics is the simulation time and not real time. ie. the simulation advancement.

Use the below code for time advancement in your simulation. 
	time_delta = 0.1
	h.helicsFederateInfoSetTimeProperty(fedinfo, h.helics_property_time_delta, time_delta)

Change the time delta as per your simulation requirement. In the above code the time advances by 0.1 sec.

You can go upto 1ns.

You can request a time using the below code
	h.helicsFederateRequestTime(vfed, time_s)  // time_s is the time you are requesting

Helics tries to move forward in time and gives you your requested time.
If that time step has aldready passed it gives you the current simulation time w.r.t time_delta
For eg. consider the below code.

	h.helicsFederateInfoSetTimeProperty(fedinfo, h.helics_property_time_delta, 0.001)
	for i in range(0,10):
		current_time = h.helicsFederateRequestTime(vfed, 1)	// I'm requesting a time of 1
		print("current Time :", current_time)
	
	Output:	
	Current Time : 1.0
	Current Time : 1.001
	Current Time : 1.002
	Current Time : 1.003
	Current Time : 1.004
	Current Time : 1.005
	Current Time : 1.006
	Current Time : 1.007
	Current Time : 1.008
	Current Time : 1.009
	Current Time : 1.01

Insights:
You can see that the time moved to step 1 for 0th iteration. 
In the next iterations, It was not able to give the requested time.
Instead it gave the current time.

Please look at example 1 to understand more about time.
